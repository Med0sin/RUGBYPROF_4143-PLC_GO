## Program 1 - Run a Go Program
#### Due: 09-12-2023 (Tuesday @ 9:30 a.m.) 


>**Note:** I've been using the long word `GoLang` instead of just `Go` when I search google or write it in docs like this one since `Go` is somewhat ambiguous and `GoLang`  is not. So ... that's why I use `GoLang` instead of `Go`.


## Dev Environment

One of the biggest hurdles in any programmers job is getting their programming environment set up. We already have a communication platform, but now we need you to have the ability to run `GoLang` code. I think the easiest place to start since the vast majority said they would be using VsCode as their coding platform is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1MXIGYrMk80. It's the video we watched that was recommended at the GoLang VsCode extension site: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/go.

This tiny tutorial has you do the following:

- write a Go package that checks to see what mascot you choose
- implement a `main.go` file to run the mascot package
- create a test to check your package is running correctly

In all honesty you should have done something similar to this already based or discussions, but this will ensure to me that you can run `GoLang` code.


## Requirements

- Follow the tutorial and create a go project as dictated in the video. This should include:
  - A mascot package (one organizational feature of Go).
  - A main.go file to call your mascot package.
  - A mascot test file. 
- The video calls the container folder `GO-DEMO-1`, I want your code to be in a folder called `P01`
- Create a `README.md` file in your project folder that follows [these](../../Resources/03-Readmees/README.md) guidelines. 
- Update your `Assignments` folder README.md to include a link to this project. Remember [this](../A02/README.md)?
- Your assignments folder README should include a table similar to the one below: 
- 
#### Assignments Readme Table
|   #   | Folder Link             | Assignment Description                 |
| :---: | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
|   1   | [A01](../A01/README.md) | [Establishing Comms](../A01/README.md) |
|   2   | [A02](../A02/README.md) | [Code Repository](../A02/README.md)    |
|   3   | [P01](../P01/README.md) | [Run a Go Program](../P01/README.md)   |



## Deliverables

- If you do not have an `Assignments` folder created in your repository, make one.
- Add your `P01` folder with all its files to your assignments folder.
- Update your repo on github.
