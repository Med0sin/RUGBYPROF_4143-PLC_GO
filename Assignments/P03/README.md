## Program 3 - Image Getter
#### Due: 10-03-2023 (Tuesday @ 9:30 a.m.) 

## Background

### Project Structure

- We are are going to keep using the same project structure as the last program. 
- But we are going to add a little functionality and give you guys a little challenge!
- Remember `projectFolder` is your `module`, and modules use `packages` to add functionality.

```
projectFolder/
├── main.go
├── go.mod
├── somePackage/
│   ├── package1.go
│   └── package2.go
```

## Overview

I want to use the code from P02 and add functionality that goLang is supposed to make `easy`. However I think all of us are realizing how important dev environments are and learning the intricacies of a new language. The previous program just opened an image and drew a rectangle on said image. Lets add some convenience and robustness to our code:

- Auto download an image from the web
- Run a small web server that provides a form to enter our url. 

### Future

- Async requests
- Parallel downloads
