## Program 3 - Image Getter

## Background

### Project Structure

- We are are going to keep using the same project structure as the last program. 
- But we are going to add a little functionality and give you guys a little challenge!
- Remember `projectFolder` is your `module`, and modules use `packages` to add functionality.

```
projectFolder/
├── main.go
├── go.mod
├── somePackage/
│   ├── package1.go
│   └── package2.go
```
