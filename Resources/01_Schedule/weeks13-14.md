## Weeks 13-14: Web Development with Go

###  Overview of web development in Go
   - Introduction to web development concepts and technologies
   - Understanding the client-server architecture
   - Overview of HTTP protocol and request-response cycle
   - Exploring the role of Go in web development

###  HTTP server programming in Go
   - Creating a basic HTTP server using the `net/http` package
   - Handling different types of HTTP requests (GET, POST, etc.)
   - Routing requests and defining request handlers
   - Serving static files and handling form submissions

###  Routing and handling requests
   - Implementing a router using the `gorilla/mux` package
   - Defining route patterns and parameters
   - Handling URL parameters and query strings
   - Implementing middleware for common functionality (logging, authentication)

###  Middleware and authentication
   - Understanding middleware in the context of web development
   - Implementing middleware functions for request processing
   - Authentication and authorization techniques in Go
   - Using session management and secure cookies

###  Introduction to web frameworks (e.g., Gin, Echo)
   - Overview of popular web frameworks in Go
   - Comparing and evaluating different frameworks
   - Exploring key features and advantages of each framework
   - Building a simple application using a web framework of choice

During this section, emphasize the fundamentals of web development in Go and highlight the simplicity and efficiency of building web applications using the Go language. Encourage students to actively experiment with code, build small web applications, and explore the different aspects of web development.

Assignments can include tasks such as building basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) applications, implementing RESTful APIs, or creating simple web applications with user authentication and authorization.

Provide opportunities for hands-on coding exercises and projects that allow students to practice routing, handling requests, and implementing middleware. Encourage them to explore and experiment with different web frameworks to gain exposure to various approaches and features.

Allocate time for discussions on web development best practices, security considerations, and performance optimization techniques specific to Go. Encourage students to share their experiences, challenges, and successes with web development projects they've worked on or researched.

Finally, consider discussing real-world examples of web applications built with Go, and showcase how Go's performance and simplicity make it a suitable choice for web development.
