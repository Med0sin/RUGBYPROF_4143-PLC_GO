# Weeks 9-10: Error Handling and Testing

## Topics

* error handling
* error testing
* error propagation
* error wrapping
* handling panics gracefully

* error handling techniques
* write unit tests 
* test-driven development (TDD) 

* testing frameworks and 
* tools that support test automation and continuous integration (CI)

* Include code reviews and discussions to analyze students' error handling strategies and test suites. 
* Encourage students to provide feedback on each other's code to reinforce good coding practices and foster collaboration.

* Q&A sessions to address questions about error handling, panics, and testing. 
* Share real-world examples of how effective error handling and thorough testing contribute to high-quality software.

* writing clear, concise, and maintainable tests to ensure code reliability and enable future development iterations.
